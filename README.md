Ellipsoids Packing
=================
Solve the problem of **Unequal Ellipsoids Close Packing** in Matlab. Before you run the code, you should add the Ellipsoidal Toolbox (ET) to your Matlab. Go https://github.com/SystemAnalysisDpt-CMC-MSU/ellipsoids.git download the toolbox and install it. 

Using the Lubachevsky-Stillinger Algorithm(LSA), ellipsoids are packed in a given cube. Optimizing the intersecting condition by caculating the volume of overlap area when ellipsoids in different position. Using Monte Carlo Method to caculate the intersection.

Thanks Peter Gagarinov, Alex Kurzhanskiy, for the useful Toolbox.
