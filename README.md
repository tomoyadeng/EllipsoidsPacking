Ellipsoids Packing
=================

Solve the problem of Unequal Ellipsoids Closse Packing in Matlab. Before you run the code, you should add the Ellipsoidal Toolbox (ET) to your Matlab. Go https://github.com/SystemAnalysisDpt-CMC-MSU/ellipsoids.git download the toolbox and install it. 

Thanks Peter Gagarinov, Alex Kurzhanskiy, for the useful Toolbox.
